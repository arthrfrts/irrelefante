Eu gostei muito [desse texto da Emily WanDerWerff](https://www.vox.com/culture/22643585/ted-lasso-season-2-two-backlash) (como sempre) que (pra variar) consegue enxergar o porquê que a segunda temporada de&nbsp;_Ted Lasso_ tá sendo tão divisora de águas.

Primeiro, tem o fato de que a natureza de uma segunda temporada é complicada. Ou ela tenta repetir a primeira, esticando sua premissa até estourar, ou pega a primeira e aprofunda em cada personagem e situação, criando a fundamentação para a série a longo prazo:

> Throughout TV history, season two was traditionally the point at which a TV show became a TV show — especially in cases where season one was popular right out of the gate. A successful second season usually meant a successful run of several seasons. If season two ran out of steam, it would often spell a show’s doom.
> 
> Two of HBO’s biggest recent hits, Westworld and Succession, reflect these make-or-break stakes. Westworld’s first season, which aired in 2016, garnered raves from all over the place, to say nothing of a ravenous fan base that decoded each and every Easter egg the sci-fi series could hide for them. Once the secrets of that first season were decoded, season two, which aired in 2018, largely fell short of expectations. It had some good episodes, but it became too obsessed with trying to recapture the puzzle box magic of season one.
> 
> In contrast, Succession’s first season, which aired in 2018, was met mostly with acclaim — but it also had just enough high-profile detractors to provoke debate over whether the central family of rich jerks was too loathsome to want to spend time with. Then Succession’s second season, which aired in 2019, deepened every single character, enriched every single conflict, and underscored the series’ core ideas of how wealth and abusive power dynamics are closely intertwined. It was one of the most critically acclaimed seasons of television in recent memory, and it won several Emmys.

Depois, ela observa como a recepção de&nbsp;_Ted Lasso_ como um todo tá sendo diferente. A primeira temporada foi um sucesso inesperado em um serviço de streaming pouco usado. A grande maioria das pessoas descobriu a série depois que a primeira temporada inteira foi lançada, enquanto que a segunda tá sendo acompanhada semanalmente — e as pessoas desaprenderam como assistir uma série semanalmente.

> As [Kathryn VanArendonk astutely notes at Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/article/ted-lasso-christmas-episode-serialization-debate.html), the reason this fight has grown so heated is that a lot of fans are essentially debating the value of goodness in art. VanArendonk also suggests, however, that what some fans are truly mad about is serialization and the way season two’s Christmas episode seemed to stop the season in its tracks.
> 
> I think VanArendonk is mostly right. The vast majority of people who watched Ted Lasso’s first season binge-watched it, and a binge-watch is necessarily a very different experience from a week-to-week watch. In a binge, episodic flaws recede to the background. Studies have even found that when you binge-watch a show, you’re [less likely to remember details about the story](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/7729/6532) than you would if you watched one episode per week.

Esse novo panorama da TV criou uma audiência que prefere narrativas que se assemelham mais a um filme — centrado em&nbsp;_eventos_, não em _personagens_&nbsp; —, e por isso as temporadas diminuem, e as minisséries se tornam a nova “TV de prestígio”:

> I love TV shows that build themselves to run forever and ever and ever. I adore Successionbecause I feel like it might run for six or seven seasons, with most of them excellent and all of them at least good. I think TV can and should sprawl, and Ted Lasso, with its large ensemble cast, is using its second season to deepen many of its supporting characters to better support sprawling in the future.
> 
> Ironically, the main hurdle standing in the way of fans embracing Ted Lasso season two might just be how much everybody loved season one. A universally beloved first season so often leads to a more heavily criticized second season, whereas a more divisive season one (see also: Succession or The Leftovers) gives a series more room to evolve in season two and thus fulfill the “It’s gotten good” narrative we increasingly apply to TV shows. Meanwhile, if a show isn’t strong and doesn’t capture a passionate audience right out of the gate, it might never get to season two. It’s a weird Catch-22 built into our current TV discussion culture.
> 
> I am also willing to admit, however, that I’m somewhat out of step with the ways in which TV is currently evolving. The more TV there is, the more we want tight, compact, novel experiences. In my view, if a show’s first season is great, then it’s great, and I’m very happy to drop a show that’s no longer working for me and catch up with the finale on Wikipedia someday. A lot of people don’t want to risk that.

Faz um tempo que eu não lia nada da autora sobre TV, e eu acho ela a melhor escritora sobre TV em atividade. Sempre bom ter alguém com tanto entendimento e amor por um meio te explicando o que tá acontecendo. É como se ela estivesse te ensinando a enxergar um pouquinho melhor.
