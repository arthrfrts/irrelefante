[Sara Benincasa](https://sarajbenincasa.medium.com/these-were-our-years-f42abe1a05de?utm_source=pocket_mylist), pensando em como vamos contar para os filhos e os netos sobre o nosso tempo:

> “In those days, I would wonder why I was sad suddenly, and exhausted, when I was lucky to have a place to live, and clean water, and a job, and a benevolent demon cat, and a family, and friends, and my books and my poetry to protect me. I would wonder if the wave of despair could simply be biochemical, if maybe I needed to take more medication, do more exercise, drink more water, pray on my hands and knees more than once a day instead of just once, half-awake each morning. I would wonder what I could do to produce the right response. And then I would remember how life works for humans, and I would think, ‘To be sad and frightened and weary is the right response. People are dying. People are in pain. I can do some of the helpful things, the good habits, the healthy behaviors, and I must do them, but sometimes the bad feelings will come in. This is the nature of the time. I can hold hope in my heart and anger too and the rage and the love alike can weigh me down. This is not a failure to heal but an affirmation that I am alive, that I am real, that I am still here and to be here means to be present for all of it, all of it.’ And so those were the days when I learned to be there for all of it, because I could hide from the illness as best I could but I could not hide from the way I felt about it. Do you see?”
