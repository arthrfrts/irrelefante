[Lauren Oyler](https://thebaffler.com/outbursts/habitual-user-oyler) escreveu um texto excelente sobre porque é tão difícil de sair das mídias sociais hoje em dia:

> In 2011, the social media theorist Nathan Jurgenson coined the term “digital dualism” to describe the fallacy that there is a dividing line between the “virtual” world and the “real” world; today he runs an online magazine, Real Life, dedicated to examining the effects of the collapsed distinction. It’s funded by Snapchat. Irony is often confusing for people on Twitter, so let me be unambiguous: this is a post-internet strain of irony (its 180-degree inversion) so consistent with your most cynical expectation that its manifestation is actually surprising: Snapchat, the company perhaps most invested in merging the real and the virtual, pays for a website called Real Life.

It’s amazing that a tech company can make me—me!—divide my self-worth into endless discrete moments and distribute them among people I’ve never met and on average don’t think are very smart. I’m not being sarcastic: it really is amazing.

Vendo o resultado das eleições nesse domingo, é preocupante como a gente divide a nossa vida hoje em dia nos apps. O que tá no app do banco é a nossa vida real — o saldo bancário, o boleto pra pagar. No app do lado, na sua rede social favorita, tá “a vida de mentirinha”, os memes, as cutucadas na opinião alheia. Essa barreira imaginária deixou de existir faz um tempo, mas só agora eu fui perceber.
